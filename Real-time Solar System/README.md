# Real-time Solar System

Real-time simulation of our Solar System in a realistic scale made in 3 weeks.

The goal was to create a real-time and realistic simulation while practicing using HDRP.

The position on the orbit was computed using Keplerian elements of each planet and the current date, following this![tutorial](http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html)

The positions of the 8 planets and the Moon on their orbits are accurate and update accordingly to the time of the year (estimated from the current date). <br>

Also the rotation of the Earth is correct and shows precisely which side faces the Sun using shaders.<br>

The other planets (note that the navigation between the solar system or the planets is done freely by clicking on the planets sprites or the return button)<br>
